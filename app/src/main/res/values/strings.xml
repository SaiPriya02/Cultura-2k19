    <string name="about">In India, a cultural festival, cultfest,
         culfest or college fest is an annual cultural event at a college
        or university organised by the student community,
        involving participants from other colleges as well.
         Professional performing artists are also typically invited,
        and a number of competitions are held for students.
        Fests are usually funded through sponsors,
        although some colleges have begun exploring the idea of crowdfunding.</string>
